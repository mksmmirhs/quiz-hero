    <h1>3. How does the event loop works?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Ans:</strong> Javascript is a single threaded language. To run
      asynchronous task whether not blocking the execution event loop kicks in.
      When asynchronous tasks comes it removes from call stack to event loop
      removes it from call stack to callback queue. then it waits to finish the
      asynchronous task. then the task is finish event loop check if the call
      stack is free or not. if the call stack is free event loop removes the
      task from queue and push it to call stack. This is how javascript deals
      with asynchronous task in a single thread non blocking way.
